#	It is extra parameters file for GADMA software.

#	Lines started from # are ignored.
#	Also comments at the end of a line are ignored too.
#	Every line contains: Identificator of parameter : value.
#	If you want to change some default parameters, you need to 
#	remove # at the begining of line and change corresponding 
#	parameter.


#	Lower and upper bounds on N - sizes of populations, 
#	T - time of time periods, M - migration rates.
#	All bounds are relative to N_A: N is in N_A units, 
#	T in 2 * N_A units and M in 1 / (2 * N_A).
#	Default:	min_N = 0.01, max_N = 100.0, min_T = 0.0, 
#				max_T = 5.0, min_M = 0.0, max_M = 10.0
