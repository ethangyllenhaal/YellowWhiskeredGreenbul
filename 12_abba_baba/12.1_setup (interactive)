# Import the appropriately-filtered, bgzipped, and indexed vcfs into each of the ABBA_BABA folders. 
#### These should have been filtered from cleaned chromosome-level vcfs that have already been corrected with RagTags. 
#### Ideally, they should have been filtered with a 34-array job that uses biallelic sites only, max mean depth at 20, and a scaffolds file to delimit chromosomes. 

# Put scaffolds.txt into both ABBA_BABA directories
# Put Greenbul_Sets_1.txt, Greenbul_Sets_2.txt, species_tree_1.nwk, and species_tree_2.nwk into the corresponding ABBA_BABA directories
